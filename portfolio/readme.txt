This is my portfolio. It gives basic idea about me. Portfolio describes my educational career, my hobbies, my projects. 
Main folder contains portfolio.html, style.css, main.js and readme.txt file.
portfolio.html contains basic texts and to add styling I used CSS. All styling is in file style.css. I used javascript function. Function is define in main.js. CSS file and js file is linked in HTML header.
I attached Images folder as these images are use in Portfolio.
All together creates portfolio.
